## Server only here for making connection possible after RTCPeerConnection if server creashes then also it will not touch the media 

#### RTCPeerConnection is the browser’s built-in engine that creates a secure, real-time, peer-to-peer connection between two users.

WHAT they will send (audio/video, codecs, tracks) → SDP

HOW to reach each other (IP/ports) → ICE

SDP is negotiated first.
ICE finds the route after.
